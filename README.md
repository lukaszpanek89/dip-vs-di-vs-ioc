dip-vs-di-vs-ioc
====================

This is a collection of simple code examples that I used during my presentations entitled _DIP vs. DI vs. IoC_. In these presentations I explain how DIP, DI, 
and IoC relate to each other, in what aspects they are similar, and in what ones they differ.

Examples for Inversion of Control (IoC)
---------------------------------------

Inversion of Control has 4 flavours:
* Dependency Injection (DI)
* Events
* Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
* Frameworks in general

Examples related to **Dependency Injection** are gathered under `com.lpanek.dev.bigpicture.dip_vs_di_vs_ioc.coffeemaker` package.

Examples related to **Events** are gathered under `com.lpanek.dev.bigpicture.dip_vs_di_vs_ioc.resources` package.

Examples related to **Aspect-Oriented Programming** are gathered under `com.lpanek.dev.bigpicture.dip_vs_di_vs_ioc.boxes` package.

There are no examples related to **Frameworks** (yet?).

Examples for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
-------------------------------------------------

Examples related to **Dependency Inversion Principle** are gathered under `com.lpanek.dev.bigpicture.dip_vs_di_vs_ioc.teams` package.

General notes on all examples
-----------------------------

1. Each example has `Application` class as its entry point. These are the classes with `main()` methods.
2. Each `Application` class is documented with JavaDoc, so one can exactly know what to expect from each example.

Enjoy!
